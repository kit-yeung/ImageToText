# Problem Definition and Scope
- **Problem:**
  - Challenge of extracting text precisely from images especially when handwritten mathematical symbols are included
  - Difficulty of translating the text that involves jargon and slang into different languages
- **Application Domain:**
  - Typed and handwritten document scanning and translation
  - Accessibility tools for visually impaired individuals with language barriers
- **Significance:**
  - Automate document processing and translation
  - Enhance global communication
- Scope:
  - Developing deep learning text extraction and translation models
  - Evaluate the performance of the system
  - Fine tuning the models to improve accuracy and efficiency
- **Limitations:** Extract and translate text only, excluding other visual contents such as tables and bullet points
- **Assumptions:** Large datasets are available for training and testing the models accurately
