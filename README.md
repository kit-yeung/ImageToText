## Description
ImageToText is a web application that extracts text or handwriting in a language from an image file that the users provided, then converts it into plain text, and finally translates it into other languages with the help of AI. Using machine learning, ImageToText attempts to reduce the language barrier by providing users with an accurate, convenient, and efficient translation with a user-friendly interface.
