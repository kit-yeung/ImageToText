## Description
ImageToText is a web application which extracts text or handwriting in a language from an image file that the users provided, then converts into plain text, and finally translates into other language with the help of AI. Using machine learning, ImageToText attempts to reduce the language barrier by providing the users an accurate, convenient, and efficient translation with a user-friendly interface.
